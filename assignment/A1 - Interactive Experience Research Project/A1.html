      <h1>Interactive Experience Study: Rich Brown's Personal Website</h1>

      <section>
        <h2>1. First Impression</h2>
        <p>
          This website has a visually appealing loading page, using a grey-toned
          turquoise background that gives a modern, clean, simple, and pleasing
          impression. On both the top and bottom of the loading screen, rapidly
          flashing capital letters appear. After entering the homepage, I
          realized it is the personal website of a UI/UX designer, Rich Brown. A
          stylish, cinematic moving-shot video of him appears in person. The
          flashing letters from the loading page turn out to be composed of the
          letters in his name.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Experience & Discrete Actions</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Scrolled up and down the homepage</li>
          <li>Clicked on a case study to view further details</li>
          <li>Clicked on the letter “B” in the bottom-right corner</li>
          <li>Clicked on the elliptical white button</li>
          <li>Browsed the whole page briefly</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Most Time-spent Parts</h2>
        <p>
          I was most attracted to his case studies. Each one features a looping
          thumbnail video directly on the main page—especially the project
          VIILLAINY.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Frequent Action</h2>
        <p>Scrolling through the homepage and clicking into case studies.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Primary Goal</h2>
        <p>
          The website aims to attract potential clients or employers, showcase
          his accomplishments so far, visualize an interactive portfolio, and
          also function a bit like a short autobiography.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>6. Goal Communication</h2>
        <p>
          This is achieved through presenting his design cases, awards,
          individual artistic style, working process, and personality.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>7. Impressions of Time-based Interaction</h2>
        <p>
          It feels like something to explore briefly in just a couple of
          minutes. At first, I wasn't very interested in the large blocks of
          text, but then I noticed some interesting design features—for example,
          when scrolling up and down, the text morphs with the scrolling
          direction.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>8. Conveyed Time-Based Pattern</h2>
        <p>
          The letter “B” in the bottom-right corner is actually an interactive
          button leading to a Q&A dialogue. In this section, he explains why the
          site was designed to be difficult to read:
        </p>

        <p>
          “It's a bit of an eye strain, but most people aren't reading this
          stuff. It's why I've put so much effort into the visuals—that's what
          you're really here for.”
        </p>

        <p>
          I think this is very well thought out. It shows he is confident in his
          design, and overall, my experience turned out to be really good. The
          text on the site works more as a decorative element than an
          informative one. This makes me feel that he is both confident and
          truly excellent in his designs.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h2>12. Most Frustrating Part</h2>
        <p>
          One frustrating aspect was that the high-resolution images and videos
          were too large, which made them slow to load and disrupted the reading
          flow. Another frustration was the navigation bar. It sometimes felt
          too minimal, making it hard to locate quickly.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>13. Most Satisfying Part</h2>
        <p>
          The most satisfying elements were the micro-interactions and
          storytelling flow, which made the site feel authentic and
          approachable. The smooth hover animations on the case study videos
          created a sense of polish and engagement. Each case study unfolded
          like a clear narrative journey—starting with the problem and demand,
          moving through the design process, and ending with visual display
          results.
